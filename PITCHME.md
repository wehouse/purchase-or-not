## What is the problem we are solving here?
- **Context** As a Bank, it is our job to sell financial products and services to clients. This frequently takes the form of 'cold calling', which is making an unsolicited call on (someone), by telephone or in person, in an attempt to sell goods or services. 

**How do we ensure our cold calling efforts are correctly targetted?**

## Analysis and Preliminary Conclusion

- **Scenario** We just launched a new financial product and our sales agents attacked the phones with rarely seen enthusiam, however after a few weeks results are not as well as we hoped.
- On further examination we started to find some correlations between several demographics of clients and their decision to purchase our services or not.
